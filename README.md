# Context:
This analysis focuses on the behavior of bank customers who are more likely to leave the bank (i.e. close their bank account). 
The goal here is to identify the behavior of customers through Exploratory Data Analysis and later on use predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to churn (leave).
